The Kubelt network is made of wallet-centric \u0026ldquo;Kubelt Cores\u0026rdquo; that look and behave any crypto wallets with the addition of content enabled APIs. These cores are configurable and composable in infinite ways with other peers on the network to create decentralized applications that fit your use case.\nWhat content means to Kubelt really is anything! Kubelt Cores can host anything from web content, user databases, web assembly (compute), and more. Kubelt Cores are also compatible with popular wallet cryptography algorithms meaning you or your users don\u0026rsquo;t need new ID protocols to use Kubelt \u0026ndash; your wallet is your entrypoint into the network!\nGetting Started #  Learn more # Read about how Kubelt works by checking out our whitepaper, why kubelt?, and our how it works page.\nBuilding applications with Kubelt # Learn how to build applications on Kubelt by reading our guides or starting with our quick start page.\nNot a developer?

Access to application data, configurations and more is controlled by APIs just like with your favorite web3 wallet.\nThese applications that can be composed in a peer-to-peer configuration, unlocking endless possibilities.\nContent management; not content storage # The current state of decentralized storage is a high-touch experience that requires a certain level of knowledge about cryptography, networking, and more.\nKubelt abstracts this complexity away with an intuitive headless content management experience for developers and non-techinical users with existing CMS plugins.\nContent to Kubelt is everything from documents, databases, rich media, wasm compute, and more. All content remains encapsualted within a Kubelt Core and distributed over a decentralized network.\nAdvantages for Web2 apps too # Connect and expand your existing application stack with an integrated edge platform to take advantage and benefit from decentralization.\nKubelt cores makes your applications wallet-aware to simplify identity protocols and enable novel, user-centric application development.\nOur Javascript tools and libraries provide a familiar developer experience to make all of this easy and intuitive.\nEventual Consistency + Consensus # Blockchain is Web3 but, Web3 is not just blockchain. The middle-tier is still centralized to provide access to bridge decentralized clients with decentralized back-ends. Smart contracts where introduced to address part of this problem but introduce new problems in speed, cost, and cascading effects (you don\u0026rsquo;t want a bug in your business logic to cause a major financial loss).\nKubelt decentralizes the middle-tier, in an eventually consistent network, in the same way as your stateless web framework moved application logic outside of databases and stored procedures while also providing novel capabilities such as:\n Interoperability with tranditional and blockchain applications. Zero-knowledge content management Multi-signing mutations Peer-to-peer collaboration  "}).add({id:3,href:"/docs/next/basics/how-it-works/",title:"How it works",description:"Kubelt decentralizes applications.",content:"Kubelt Cores # At the heart of Kubelt is the \u0026ldquo;Kubelt Core\u0026rdquo;, an application container designed to look and feel just like a supercharged Web3 wallet.\nThe Kubelt Core extends the standard wallet APIs with multi-signer, content, and networking capabilities. These capabilities can be configured and organized in a way to build decentralized applications. Kubelt provides several libraries, tools and applications to work with and manage cores.\nIn essence, Kubelt Cores turns every user is a stand-alone, local-first, edge application that can be composed in a peer-to-peer configuration, unlocking endless possibilities.\nCollaboration # Kubelt uses your existing wallet accounts as your entrypoint to the network. By signing into our application, a restricted Kubelt Core that matches your wallet address will be created or retrieved from the network. This Kubelt Core is restricted in the sense that it can only have one signer that matches the address of the Kubelt Core.\nWithin your restricted Kubelt Core context you can begin to create or authenticate yourself into other Kubelt Core contexts (imagine having multiple pairs of ðŸ‘“ that you can wear). These other Kubelt Cores can be configured with multiple signers assigned various role based access controls. In doing so, you\u0026rsquo;ve now enabled collaboration applications that are wallet-aware.\nMulti-signer Kubelt Cores can expose different network capabilities such as content management APIs, web sockets, web RTC brokering, and more.\nContent Management # Every Kubelt Core is enabled with content management APIs for publishing and retrieving content and can be configured to be accessible through traditinoal API gateways or with our libraries and tools.\nAny type of content can be packed into the Kubelt Cores. For instance, you can publish simple images, documents, and other static content or you can publish user databases, wasm compute, CRDTs, and even semantic graphs. All content also uses a content addresses naming system to ensure compatability with decentralized content networks like IPFS.\nKubelt Cores can be utilized in endless ways and even composed to together to create more complex applications.\nComposability # Kubelt Cores are desigined to be super flexible in configuration and usage. In other words, a core in physical space is just a core but in logical space, these cores can be arranged to behave in any desired way.\nA simple example would be to create a multi-signer \u0026ldquo;organization core\u0026rdquo; called @acmecorp that is a gatekeeper to several \u0026ldquo;@widget\u0026rdquo; cores. The @acmecorp gating core can then be configured with a CNAME to expose it over http so that the @widget cores are easily queried. By doing so, api.kubelt.com/@0x123abc/@0x456xyz becomes widgets.acme.org/@widget.\nA similar configuration can be used so that if @acmecorp is a SaaS-like or blockchain application with it\u0026rsquo;s own users, \u0026ldquo;user cores\u0026rdquo; can be created and configured on the fly. For example, a @acmecorp/@\u0026lt;user wallet address\u0026gt; core can be used to private user content or @acmecorp/@\u0026lt;smart contract\u0026gt; core can be used to gate access to NFT content.\nLastly, by using content addresses as the primary naming convention, content can created, signed, and exchanged between cores to solve complex business problems in novel yet simple ways. Imagine creating cores that authorize the creation of a content address to your bank account encrypted to a third-party\u0026rsquo;s public key (e.g. QuickBooks) for easy and better Open Banking.\nExtendability # We are building Kubelt Cores as a decentralized application framework.
